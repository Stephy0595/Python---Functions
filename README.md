# Python---Functions
1.	What does the len() function do in Python? Write a code example using len() to find the length of a list.
   
      The len() function in Python is used to determine the number of items in an object. This could be the number of elements in a list, the number of characters in a string or the number of keys in a dictionary.

2.	Write a Python function greet(name) that takes a person's name as input and prints "Hello, [name]!".

3.	 Write a Python function find_maximum(numbers) that takes a list of integers and returns the maximum value without using the built-in max() function. Use a loop to iterate through the list and compare values.


4.	Explain the difference between local and global variables in a Python function. Write a program where a global variable and a local variable have the same name and show how Python differentiates between them.
   
     Difference Between Local and Global Variables: 

     Local Variables:
  	
      • Defined inside a function.
  	
      • Their scope is limited to the function where they are defined.
  	
      • They are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function ends.
  	
      Global Variables:
  	
      • Defined outside all functions and have a global scope.
  	
      • Can be accessed and modified inside a function using the global keyword.
  	
      • They exist throughout the program's execution

5.	Create a function calculate_area(length, width=5) that calculates the area of a rectangle. If only the length is provided, the function should assume the width is 5. Show how the function behaves when called with and without the width argument.
